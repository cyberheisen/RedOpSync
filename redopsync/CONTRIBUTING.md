# Contributing

For now, RedOpSync accepts bug reports and feature requests freely.

## Code contributions
To preserve the option for the maintainer to offer commercial licensing in the future, any code contribution requires a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) (or copyright assignment) granting the maintainer permission to relicense contributions.

Until a CLA workflow is set up, please do not submit code pull requests—open an issue instead.
